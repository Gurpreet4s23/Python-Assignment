# Python-Assignment (Readme File)

Welcome to the Python Code Repository! This repository hosts a collection of Python programs covering a variety of topics, ranging from basic calculations to more complex algorithms. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn Python or an experienced programmer seeking reference materials, this repository has something for everyone.

Python is a well-known programming language that may be used on a server to build web applications.

## Installation

You must have Python 3.x installed on your computer to use this project. Python can be downloaded from the official website.

Once Python is installed, you can either download the zip file directly from GitHub or use Git to clone the repository to your local computer.

The repository is organized into different sections, each containing Python programs on various topics:

## 1. Turtle Graphics
Explore the world of visual programming with the Turtle module. Create mesmerizing patterns and designs with simple Python code.

circle_of_squares.py: Draw a circle made up of squares using the Turtle graphics library.
## 2. Basic Calculator
Perform basic arithmetic operations using a simple calculator program.

basic_calculator.py: Implement a calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
## 3. Recursion and Series
Dive into recursion and explore Fibonacci series, factorials, and more.

fibonacci_nth_term.py: Find the Nth term in a Fibonacci series using recursion.
factorial_recursive.py: Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.
## 4. Mathematical Operations
From leap years to quadratic equations, these programs cover a range of mathematical operations.

leap_year_check.py: Check if a given year is a leap year or not.
quadratic_equation_roots.py: Find the roots of a quadratic equation.
prime_number_check.py: Determine whether a given integer is a prime number.
## 5. Lists and Arrays
Learn about working with lists and arrays in Python.

insert_into_list.py: Insert a number at any position in a list.
largest_in_list.py: Find the largest number in a list without using built-in functions.
odd_numbers_array.py: Identify odd numbers in an array.
## 6. Searching and Sorting
Master searching algorithms to find elements efficiently.

binary_search.py: Implement binary search to find an element in a sorted list.
linear_search.py: Implement linear search to find an element in an unsorted list.
## 7. Geometry
Calculate properties of geometric shapes.

circle_properties.py: Calculate the circumference and area of a circle given its radius.
geometric_mean.py: Find the geometric mean of a list of numbers.
